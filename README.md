# Verilog Learning Journey 
## Introduction
Welcome to my Verilog repository! This is where I store the Verilog programs I've written during my journey to learn and practice as I work towards becoming an **engineer** in the **semiconductor industry**.
I hold a degree in *Mechatronics Engineering** and am currently building a strong foundation in **RTL Design** and **Design Verification**. Although I am at the beginning of my journey, I am putting in consistent effort to achieve my goal of becoming a professional **Chip design engineer**. This repository is a testament to my commitment and self-learning capability. 

## Goal
1. **Short-term**: Gain proficiency in Verilog programming and develop a solid understanding of the RTL Design process. And also knowledge of the Semiconductor industry.
2. **Long-term**: Become an expert in chip design and verification, contributing to the growth of the semiconductor industry in Vietnam and globally.

## Repository Content 
- There are two main programs:
  - Verilog code for Combinational Circuits.
  - Verilog code for Sequential Circuits. 
- Number of programs: 30+ 
- Topics covered:
  - Basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR).
  - Adders and subtractors.
  - Counters and shift registers.
  - FSM (Finite State Machine).
  - Multiplexers, decoders, encoders, and many other fundamental modules. 
Each program includes: 
- Code written in Verilog
- Testbenches for simulation and validation. 
- Simulation on ModalSim
- A detailed README file for every program. 

## A Note to Recruiters
I believe my dedication and self-learning ability will serve as a solid foundation for my growth in the semiconductor field.
This repository is the clearest demonstration of my commitment, learning process, and determination to achieve my career goals.
I am eager to apply what I have learned and further develop my skills in a professional working environment.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone http://github.com/taytruong13/verilog.git
```
2. Browse through the directories to find the program you want to run. 
3. Simulate the design using EDA tool (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado, etc.).


## Future Plans
1. Complete advanced RTL Design projects (e.g., Mini SoC).
2. Begin exploring Physical Design and FPGA development.
