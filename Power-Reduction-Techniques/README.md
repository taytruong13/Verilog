# Power Reduction Techniques in RTL Design

This repository showcases various **power reduction techniques** implemented at the **RTL (Register-Transfer Level)** using Verilog. The goal is to demonstrate practical methods to reduce power consumption in digital designs, accompanied by testbenches for validation and detailed explanations.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into four key power reduction techniques. Each folder contains the Verilog implementation, testbench, and detailed README files for the specific technique.

## Techniques Implemented

### 1. **Clock Gating**
- **Description**: Reduces power by disabling the clock signal to unused modules or registers.
- **Implementation**: A clock-gated 8-bit register that updates only when an enable signal is active.


### 2. **Operand Isolation**
- **Description**: Prevents unnecessary logic activity by isolating operands in combinational circuits.
- **Implementation**: An 8-bit adder with operand isolation that activates only when needed.


### 3. **Low-Power FSM (Finite State Machine)**
- **Description**: Minimizes switching activity in FSMs using Gray Code encoding for state transitions.
- **Implementation**: A 4-state FSM where consecutive states differ by only one bit.

### 4. **Multi-Voltage Design**
- **Description**: Simulates a multi-voltage system with high- and low-performance modules.
- **Implementation**: A system dynamically switches between high and low performance modes based on control signals.


## Future Enhancements
- Add dynamic power analysis reports using tools like Synopsys SpyGlass.
- Include designs for power gating and DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling).
- Provide Python scripts to automate power simulations.
